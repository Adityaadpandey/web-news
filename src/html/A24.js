          <p>
            <b>Rhonda Kampert was an early adopter.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            She bought six Bitcoins in 2013, when they cost about $80 (£60)
            each, and were the chatter of niche corners of the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I used to listen to a radio talk show and they started talking
            about crypto and Bitcoin so I got interested," she says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Back then buying it was so complicated but I fumbled my way through
            the process and bought my coins."
          </p>

          <p>
            Rhonda, who lives in the US state of Illinois, spent some of her
            digital money over the next year or so, then forgot about it.
          </p>

          <p>
            But when she saw headlines late in 2017 announcing that the value of
            Bitcoin had risen to nearly $20,000 she excitedly went to her
            computer to log in and cash out.
          </p>

          <h2>'It was awful'</h2>

          <p>
            Except there was a problem. She was missing some of the login
            details for her Bitcoin wallet - a computer program or device that
            stores a set of secret numbers, or private keys.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I realised then that my printout had missed some digits on the end
            of my wallet identifier. I had a piece of paper with my password but
            no idea what my wallet ID was," Rhonda says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It was awful. I tried everything for months but it was hopeless. So
            I kind of gave up."
          </p>

          <p>
            Fast forward to last spring and the value of Bitcoin soared above
            $50,000 - more than 600 times what Rhonda had paid eight years
            earlier.
          </p>

          <p>
            Filled with a renewed determination to find her coins, she hit the
            internet and came across father and son crypto treasure hunters
            Chris and Charlie Brooks.
          </p>
          <img src={a24im2} alt="" />
          <p>
            "After talking to the guys online for a while I trusted them enough
            to hand over all the details I could remember. Then I waited," she
            says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Eventually we sat down together on a video call and watched
            everything happen. Chris opened the wallet and there it was. I just
            felt so relieved!"
          </p>

          <p>
            Rhonda's wallet of three-and-a-half Bitcoin was at that point worth
            $175,000.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I gave Chris and Charlie their 20%, then the first thing I did was
            take out $10,000 worth of my coins to help my daughter Megan through
            college."
          </p>

          <p>
            She says she's keeping the rest locked away in a hardware wallet - a
            security device like a USB stick that stores her details offline.
            The login pin for her new hardware wallet is etched firmly in her
            memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rhonda is hoping the coins, currently worth $43,000 each, will go up
            in value again. She describes them as her retirement fund for when
            she wants to quit her job as a day trader in stocks and
            crypto-currencies.
          </p>
          <h2>Lost billions</h2>
          <p>There are plenty of Rhondas out there who need help.</p>

          <p>
            One estimate from crypto researchers Chainalysis suggests that out
            of the 18.9 million Bitcoins in circulation, as many as 3.7 million
            have been lost by owners.
          </p>

          <p>
            And in the decentralised world of crypto-currency no-one is in
            charge - so if you forget your wallet login details there aren't
            many places you can turn to.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris and Charlie estimate that services like theirs, which use
            computers to try out hundreds of thousands of possible login ID and
            password combinations, could recover 2.5% of those lost Bitcoin -
            worth about $3.9bn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris started his business, Crypto Asset Recovery, in 2017, but
            stopped and focused on other projects for a while. He then revived
            it after a conversation with his son, Charlie, a little over a year
            ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            "I was on a break from college, and I had done some travelling but
            was just home workshopping business ideas with my dad," says
            Charlie, now 20.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We came up with the idea of restarting the business so over the
            next few weeks, we brought servers in-house and fired everything
            back up again."
          </p>

          <p>
            Working from a workshop in their seaside family home in New
            Hampshire, the father and son began receiving more than 100 emails
            and calls a day from potential clients the last time the price of
            Bitcoin peaked, in November 2021.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that it has dropped a little they are working through the
            backlog of cases.
          </p>

          <p>
            The business is going so well that Charlie has no intention of
            finishing his computer science degree. However, the pair joke that
            they spend their time in perpetual disappointment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Starting with the faint memory or jumbled paperwork of their
            clients, which provide clues about possible login details, they say
            they are only successful about 30% of the time.
          </p>
          <p>Even then, they're often disappointed by what they find.</p>

          <p>
            "Most of the time we can't actually tell what's inside the wallet so
            we have to trust the client that there is an amount that's worth the
            work we put in," Charlie says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We had a case over the summer where the person told us they had 12
            Bitcoin. We were obviously very professional with him but behind the
            computer screen we're like jumping around high-fiving each other,
            all excited about the potential payday.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We spent probably 60 hours of computer server time plus about 10
            hours with the client piecing together all the clues he could give
            us.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Then on the video call we cracked it open - and it was completely
            empty."
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris and Charlie say that only one client has ever underestimated
            what was inside his wallet. It turned out to be their biggest haul
            yet - $280,000 of Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past year they say they've recovered Bitcoins totalling
            "seven figures" in value.
          </p>
          <h2>Hardware hacking</h2>
          <p>
            The father-and-son team are part of a growing industry of ethical
            hackers using their skills to help people retrieve mislaid
            crypto-currency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another is Joe Grand, who started hacking as a teenager and is well
            known in the hacking community for testifying before the US Senate
            in 1998 about early internet vulnerabilities under his internet
            handle, Kingpin.
          </p>
          <img src={a24im3} alt="" />
          <p>
            He recently made a viral YouTube video showing how he cracked open a
            hardware wallet containing $2m of a crypto-currency called Theta.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took months of preparation and practice hacks on other hardware
            wallets for Joe to come up with a method in his workshop in
            Portland, Oregon.
          </p>

          <p>
            He finally succeeded by combining two previously discovered
            vulnerabilities with the hardware wallet in question, which showed
            they can "glitch" and give away their pin code if attacked with
            carefully timed electrical shocks.
          </p>

          <p>
            "When you break a crypto-wallet, I mean when you break any security
            really, it feels like magic no matter how many times you do it," he
            says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Even though I had proven multiple times in my tests that I could
            hack this wallet I was worried on the day because you never know
            what's going to happen and we only had one shot or the whole thing
            could break and the coins would be lost forever.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Cracking the wallet open was a huge adrenaline rush. I guess it's
            like a technical version of treasure hunting."
          </p>

          <p>
            Joe's day job is teaching manufacturers how to secure their products
            from hackers but he's now set up a wallet-unlocking side-business
            with his first client, Dan Reich.
          </p>

          <p>
            "If there's big enough wallets and big enough treasure to dedicate
            my time to," he says, "then we're going to try."
