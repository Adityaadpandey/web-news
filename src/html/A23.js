              A US company is speeding up the path to practical fusion energy by

            By applying software that can improve on its own, TAE Technologies
            has cut down tasks that once took two months to just a few hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Google has lent the firm its expertise in "machine learning" in
            order to help accelerate the timeline for fusion.

          <p>
            Nuclear fusion promises a plentiful supply of low-carbon energy,
            using the same process that powers the Sun.
          </p>

          <p>
            Existing nuclear power is based on fission, where a heavy chemical
            element is split to provide a lighter one. Nuclear fusion works by
            combining two light elements to make a heavier one.
          </p>

          <p>
            For fusion to become economically-viable, it must first generate
            more energy than the amount being put in. But no one has yet reached
            this point, despite an eight-decade effort to "build a star on
            Earth". The challenges are immense, but some in the fusion community
            hope that new thinking and disruptive technologies could help
            shatter this paradigm.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I want to deliver fusion first, but anyone who does it is a hero,"
            TAE's chief executive Dr Michl Binderbauer told BBC News.

            TAE, located in leafy Foothill Ranch, south-east of Los Angeles, has
            raised over $880m in private funding - more than any other fusion
            company. High-profile backing has come from Goldman Sachs, the
            Rockefeller family and the late Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.
            Its board of directors includes a former US Energy Secretary, Ernest
            Moniz.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company's 30m (100ft) -long fusion cylinder - called C2W
            "Norman" after TAE's founder, physicist Norman Rostoker, who died in
            2014 - represents a different approach to the doughnut-shaped
            "tokamak" to be used for the world's biggest fusion experiment, the
            multi-billion-euro ITER project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Controlling plasma at tens of millions of degrees requires a
            finely-tuned system. Google's expertise in machine learning - where
            computer algorithms improve with experience - has been used for
            "optimising" TAE's fusion device.
          </p>

          <p>
            Optimisation, or tuning for best performance, is carried out when
            something on the device changes, such as new hardware being added.
            This process once took around two months, but with machine learning,
            "we can now optimise in fractions of an afternoon," Dr Binderbauer
            explained.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The way the rate of learning has accelerated is incredible and
            allows us to make changes much more readily." Machine learning is
            also used to reconstruct what's going on during a fusion experiment,
            or "shot". Multiple strands of data can be pulled together for a
            deeper understanding of the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            "That's incredibly computer-dense and is a problem heretofore fairly
            few people even attempted to attack," the CEO explains. He says the
            results of the partnership with Google could shave a year from the
            company's longer-term schedule, which envisages a commercial fusion
            test device by 2030.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has already come a long way: Rostoker, a professor at
            University of California Irvine, founded it as Tri-Alpha Energy in
            1998. Austrian-born Binderbauer was one of Rostoker's PhD students,
            and became the company's CEO four years ago. The two physicists
            chose TAE's approach by starting with the requirements for a fusion
            power plant and working backwards.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using a hot, electrically-charged gas called plasma, fast-moving
            particles can fuse, releasing energy. The $150m "Norman" device
            crashes together two balls of plasma at supersonic speeds inside the
            tube. Magnetic fields, in what's known as a Field-Reversed
            Configuration (FRC), are used to control the process - which happens
            in just 40 millionths of a second.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Prof Jeremy Chittenden, of Imperial College London, TAE
            is "doing something quite different to what everyone else is doing".
            Rather than relying on the heat of the plasma to generate
            fast-moving particles for fusion, the device uses external particle
            beams which are fired into the hot gas, similar to what happens in a
            particle accelerator. "That's your fusion source," he explains.

          <p>
            Fusion efforts such as ITER will use fuel consisting of deuterium
            and tritium - two heavy versions of the element hydrogen. This
            produces energy from fusion at tens of millions of degrees C, which
            is still at a lower temperature than some other options. However,
            there are downsides: tritium is radioactive, wears down the insides
            of fusion reactors, and has a finite supply.
          </p>

          <p>
            The "Norman" device powers its reactions with "regular" hydrogen and
            deuterium - a more benign, if less potent choice. But these are good
            surrogates for the fuel TAE eventually wants to move on to -
            hydrogen and boron. This produces no neutron particles and therefore
            little radioactivity, making machines straightforward to service and
            maintain. But this fuel also requires extremely high temperatures.
          </p>

          <p>
            C2W "Norman" operates at around 70 million degrees C, but
            hydrogen-boron fuel requires temperatures to rise by a factor of
            20-30, to several billion degrees C. It's a major challenge: "Powers
            of ten are a big deal in science," says Binderbauer, "Can we get to
            hydrogen-boron? I'm very convinced we can."
          </p>
          <img src={a23im5} alt="" />
          <p>
            Professor Roddy Vann, a plasma physicist at the University of York,
            UK, who works on fusion with tokamaks, said: "Whilst you've got to
            get the temperature right, the temperature and the density and the
            energy confinement time all have to be sufficiently high,
            simultaneously."
          </p>

          <p>
            While neutrons do produce some radioactivity in the tokamak
            structure, he explains, it's also their energy that we capture in
            "conventional" deuterium-tritium fusion. However, said Prof Vann:
            "If we could do aneutronic fusion, and could do it at temperatures
            that were achievable, that would be very interesting."
          </p>

          <p>
            Prof Chittenden explained: "Because they're not doing this through
            heat, but through particle acceleration, that disadvantage of
            [hydrogen-boron fuel] drops away," adding: "The net gain through
            realising something as a commercial fusion plant is potentially
            huge, because a vast fraction of the cost of a deuterium-tritium
            plant is handling the radioactive products."
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr Binderbauer says TAE's approach is also less susceptible to
            turbulence - which hampers the ability to control plasmas in
            tokamaks - and to energy leaking from the machine. In fact, the leak
            rate goes down as the temperature in the device goes up, he says.
            "As you get more energetic, the behaviour gets more manageable, more
            predictable, more reliable," he says.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two reactors are being planned to follow "Norman" - Copernicus and
            Da Vinci. A key goal within a decade is to produce net energy, where
            the output from fusion exceeds the energy supplied to initiate
            reactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            After nearly 25 years in existence, TAE has pioneered technology
            with applications beyond just fusion. It is refining a technique
            called boron neutron capture therapy with a view to its use in
            cancer treatment. And it has formed a new division to commercialise
            the power management systems from its work on C2W "Norman" for use
            in the electric car and energy storage sectors.
