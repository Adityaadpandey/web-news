              Meta's Oversight Board has advised the social network to change
              its policy on allowing the sharing of people's addresses, even if
              the information is considered public.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Meta requested the advice last year - the first time it has asked
            the board to help define one of its policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            It follows a series of leaks on <p>social media of high-profile
            people's addresses.
          </p>

          <p>
            This so-called doxxing could cause real-world harms, the board
            advised.
          </p>

          <p>
            Doxxing refers to the release of private information about
            individuals online, usually with malicious intent.
          </p>
            <h2>Tricky reality</h2>
            
          <p>In November, Harry Potter author JK Rowling said she was a victim - after a photograph taken outside her home, revealing its address, was circulated online.</p>
          <p>But in January, police said no action would be taken against the activists who had targeted her.</p>

          <p>Facebook, owned by Meta, does not allow the sharing of private residential information generally - unless it is already "publicly available".</p>

          <p>But in June, it asked the board to further consider the tricky reality that while potentially relevant to journalism and activism, access to such information could also risk residents' safety.

            </p>
            <h2>Malicious sharing</h2>

<p>In response, the Oversight Board has issued a detailed 17-point plan and said the "publicly available" exception should no longer apply.</p>

<p>It also said Meta should "swiftly" respond to anyone claiming to have fallen victim to doxxing, regardless of whether they had Facebook account.</p>

<p>"The malicious sharing of private residential addresses on social media is a serious problem that can lead to real-world harms, including stalking and harassment," said Oversight Board director Thomas Hughes.</p>

<p>Meta will not have to implement the recommendations - but it must respond within 60 days.
