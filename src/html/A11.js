              The code that powers the website of the viral puzzle game Wordle
              can be copied and saved to continue playing it for the next seven
              years, it has been revealed.

          <p>
            The finding comes amid concerns that the game's sale to the New York
            Times may mean it stops being free to play.
          </p>

          <p>
            The code, written in Javascript, appears as plain text for those who
            know how to access it.

            Some publications have even printed a step by step guide of how to
            do it.

            "Effectively you can keep a version of the game as it exists today
            with enough data to keep you going for a long time," said Prof Alan
            Woodward, a computer scientist from University of Surrey.

            But, he added: "As you have the words stored locally it might be
            tempting to cheat, and where's the fun in that?"
          </p>
          <p>
            He added it would not be "too difficult" to split the question grid
            from the answers.

            "You'd need to hold the data in a file that was inaccessible other

            That may sound like a lot of effort for a daily word game that

            clues along the way.

            The creator Josh Wardle recently sold his game to the New York Times
            for a seven-figure sum. He had originally said he did not want to
            make any money from the game he created as a distraction for himself
            and his partner during lockdown.
          </p>

          <p>And copying the code may carry legal risk.</p>

          <p>
            Nick Allan, legal director at law firm Lewis Silkin, told the BBC:
            "The particular expression of the software code underlying a game
            like Wordle will be protected as a literary copyright work under UK
            copyright law," he said.
          </p>

          <p>
            "It is not possible to waive UK copyright, and the copyright
            provided on the Wordle website is not obviously licensed to the
            general public on a free, perpetual open-source basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Unless Mr Wardle has provided this type of general licence to the
            public, he or the New York Times are likely to still retain the
            right to enforce the copyright as they see fit."
          </p>

          <p>
            That means that anyone replicating it or creating a clone game could
            be liable for copyright infringement, at least in the UK courts.
          </p>

          <p>What next for Wordle and its fans?</p>

          <p>
            It might be possible, added Mr Allan, to create a game using
            different lines of code that achieve the same result.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Either way this is a complex area, fraught with legal risk for
            anyone thinking of using this code to release their own Wordle."
          </p>

          <p>
            And it is likely that the website will be completely re-engineered
            when the New York Times takes charge.
