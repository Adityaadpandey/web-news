                    <h1>India says it will launch digital rupee as soon as this year</h1>
                    <p><b>India's finance minister has said the country will launch a digital version of the rupee as early as this year.</b></p>
                    <p>In her annual budget speech, Nirmala Sitharaman also outlined plans for a 30% tax on income from digital assets.</p>

                    <p>It would put profits from trading or transferring cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens in the country's highest tax band.</p>

                    <p>India is the latest major economy to announce an official virtual currency, as China trials the digital yuan.</p>

                    <p>"Introduction of a central bank digital currency will give a boost, a big boost to (the) digital economy," Ms Sitharaman said on Tuesday.</p>

                    <p>"Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system," she added.</p>

                    <p>Ms Sitharaman also said the magnitude and frequency of digital asset transactions "have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime", where profits from transactions are taxed.</p>

                    <p>The tax would also apply to gifts of digital assets, with recipients being liable to pay the levy. Taxes for all other transactions would be deducted at source.</p>

                    <p>The announcement came as Ms Sitharaman unveiled the Indian federal government's <b>annual budget.</b></p>

                    <p>It included ramping up spending on infrastructure and extended credit guarantees to struggling small businesses.</p>

                    <p>Asia's third largest economy has been hit hard by the pandemic with major job losses and rising inflation.</p>
