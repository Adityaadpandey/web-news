          <h1>Amazon and Nike exploring Peloton takeover, reports say</h1>
          <img src={a16im1} alt="" />
          <p>
            <b>
              Home fitness firm Peloton Interactive is turning the heads of
              potential buyers such as e-commerce giant Amazon and sports brand
              Nike, reports say.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Peloton is deciding whether to accept any bids, according to the
            reports.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sales of its exercise bikes and treadmills soared during the
            pandemic as people stayed at home but demand has slowed after
            lockdowns were eased.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has also faced a number of other challenges in recent
            months, sending its shares sharply lower.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amazon declined to confirm or deny whether it is considering making
            an offer for the US exercise equipment maker.
          </p>

          <p>
            "We don't comment on rumours and speculation," a spokesperson told
            the BBC.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peloton and Nike did not immediately respond to requests for
            comment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The firm's shares surged in extended trading after the reports first
            emerged.
          </p>

          <p>
            The once-stock market favourite has seen its shares slump in recent
            months, losing more than 80% of its value in the last year.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the pandemic saw gyms close in 2020 demand for Peloton's exercise
            equipment and remote workout classes jumped, sending its share price
            soaring.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as lockdowns eased the appetite for its bikes and
            treadmills has dwindled.
          </p>

          <p>
            In August, the firm cut the price of its flagship bike by 20% to
            $1,495 (Â£1,105), as it revealed that its losses had widened and
            revenue growth had slowed.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the same month the US Department of Justice and the Department of
            Homeland Security said they were investigating the company after a
            child was pulled under one of its treadmills and killed, while other
            customers had reported injuries.
          </p>

          <p>
            In November, Peloton warned investors that it expected revenue to
            slow in the year ahead.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The primary drivers of our reduced forecast are a more pronounced
            tapering of demand related to the ongoing opening of the economy,
            and a richer than anticipated mix of sales to our original bike," it
            said in a recent letter to shareholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last month, investment firm Blackwells Capital called for Peloton's
            chief executive John Foley to be removed from his post and the
            business to be put up for sale.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peloton and its customer base are "extremely attractive" to
            companies like Nike, Apple, Disney and Sony, that are looking to
            boost their presence in the home, health and wellness and media
            spaces, Blackwells said in a letter to Peloton's board.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company also made headlines after two television dramas, the Sex
            and the City revival And Just Like That and Billions, featured story
            lines in which characters suffered heart attacks while using Peloton
            bikes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Peloton is due to publish its second quarter earnings on Tuesday.
