              When Tanya Short first pitched the idea for Boyfriend Dungeon, a
              computer game where the player's romantic partners are
              monster-vanquishing weapons, publishers didn't seem overly
              interested.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            "They all rejected it. They said the name wasn't interesting, or
            they just didn't understand it," says Ms Short, the director and
            chief executive of independent game studio, Kitfox Games.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was only after a growing buzz about the game, and some initial
            funds, via Kickstarter, that the games platforms changed their tune.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boyfriend Dungeon is now available on a variety of systems,
            including PC, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.
          </p>

          <p>
            ut Ms Short worries that quirky games like hers, designed by
            creatively independent studios, will have an even harder route to
            market in the future - because the biggest corporate firms in gaming
            are expanding.
          </p>

            In January, Microsoft
            <b>
              <u>said it plans to buy Activision Blizzard,</u>
            </b>{" "}
            one of the world's largest game developers. At just less than $69bn
            (£51bn), it would be the biggest takeover in video games history and
            sees Microsoft gain franchises like Call of Duty and Warcraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just weeks later, rival, Sony announced a deal to buy game developer
            Bungie, worth $3.6bn (£2.7bn).
          </p>

          <p>
            Reportedly, Microsoft's deal will still have to satisfy the scrutiny
            of the US Federal Trade Commission, whose chair, Lina Khan, has
            expressed some opposition to big tech monopolies.

          <img src={a18im2} alt="" />
          <p>
            Ms Short is one of a number of indie game developers who have told
            BBC News they are worried about what the deal could mean for the
            industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Microsoft insists it will continue to cater for small, independent
            developers. But some of those developers are deeply concerned, for
            instance, that if the Microsoft-owned, Game Pass subscription
            service, increasingly becomes the only means through which many
            people access games, small studios could be left competing for
            funding and promotion via that platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            It could be viewed as a video game version of the problem that some
            artists say they face on music streaming platform, Spotify.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ms Short also points out that, currently, indie studios already
            avoid launching their games in the run-up to Christmas, since so
            many large, or "triple-A" titles are released during that period.
            Think Call of Duty or FIFA. But with greater consolidation of large
            developers - and platforms, such as Xbox and Game Pass, calling more
            of the shots - things could get even trickier.
          </p>

          <p>
            "This Activision acquisition strikes fear in us because it makes it
            so much more obvious - maybe they could dominate the rest of the
            year and then what do we do?" she says.

            Yura Zhdanovich, founder and game director at Sad Cat Studios, leads
            a team of around 20 people who are working on a cyberpunk adventure
            game, Replaced. It features an artificial intelligence hunting for
            meaning in a dystopian urban landscape.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it's released later this year, the game will appear on Game
            Pass and some other platforms. Mr Zhdanovich praises Microsoft in
            terms of how the firm has worked with his studio so far, though he
            says he worries about whether there will be enough support for indie
            developers in the future.

            While Game Pass currently offers some indie titles, among the 500 or
            so games available on the service, there aren't that many of them,
            according to Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at Ampere Analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            He says it is hard to predict what would happen if gamers were to
            increasingly sign up to Game Pass, or similar services, in the
            future, and move entirely away from buying games individually.
          </p>
          <img src={a18im4} alt="" />
          <p>
            "Conceivably, indie games outside of these services might lose
            engagement as subscribers focus most of their attention on games
            they can access for free within the service," he adds.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's a concern because indie studios are currently in a "race to the
            bottom" in terms of revenue, says Jake Simpson of TNB Studios, a
            seasoned developer who has worked with Microsoft and Activision,
            among others.
          </p>

          <p>

            "People are prepared to spend $1,000 dollars (£740) on a telephone
            and then get very offended if you ask them to pay $4.99 for a game,"
            says Simpson, who praises the innovation and creativity of many
            small developers.

            AI researcher and game designer, Mike Cook at Queen Mary University
            of London, says that there is an "overcrowding" problem that means
            it is hard for good games to find their audience. Very small
            developers, in particular, are feeling that pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            "The dream of individual people making games and publishing them has
            become a lot harder over the last few years," says Dr Cook.

            It is possible to self-publish Xbox games via Microsoft's ID@Xbox
            scheme.
          </p>

          <p>
            he company's Sarah Bond, corporate vice president at Xbox's Gaming
            Ecosystem Organisation, argues that Game Pass will, if anything,
            benefit indie developers by introducing them to new and unfamiliar
            types of game.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an example, she says that of the people who tried indie puzzle
            game, Human Fall Flat, on Game Pass, 60% had never played a puzzle
            game before. And that 40% of those people went on to buy{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            "We are continuing to invest with indie developers and we will
            continue to do so as the service grows," Ms Bond says in an
            interview with the BBC, though she declined to discuss specifics.
          </p>

          <p>
            "No, it will not make us a monopoly," she adds, referring to the
            planned deal with Activision.

          <img src={a18im5} alt="" />
          <p>
            Anisa Sanusi, a video game user interface designer, says news of the
            Microsoft-Activision deal has left indie studios "on guard".
          </p>

          <p>
            She says she is concerned that Microsoft's acquisition of game
            companies could lead to an overall decline in competition within the
            industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's important that indie developers survive, she adds, not just for
            creative diversity, but because smaller companies often provide less
            pressurised environments for artists, writers and programmers
          </p>

          <p>
            "We know the money's there, we know it's a lucrative business," she
            says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "Yet, we still, as indie developers… we're kind of clawing our way."
