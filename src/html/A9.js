              Meta has announced a new feature to allow more personal space for
              people's avatars in virtual-reality worlds.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The metaverse is still at concept stage but the latest attempts to
            create virtual worlds are already facing an age-old problem:
            harassment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bloomberg's technology columnist Parmy Olson told the BBC's Tech
            Tent programme about her own "creepy" experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            And one woman likened her own traumatic experience in VR to sexual
            abuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meta has now announced a new feature, Personal Boundary, which
            begins rolling out on 4 February. It prevents avatars from coming
            within a set distance of each other, creating more personal space
            for people and making it easier to avoid these unwanted
            interactions.
          </p>

          <p>
            It stops others "invading your avatar's personal space", said Meta.
          </p>
<p>"If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary." </p>

<p>It is being made available in Meta's Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues software. </p>

<p>The firm said it was a "powerful example of how VR has the potential to help people interact comfortably," but acknowledged there was more work to be done.</p>
<h2>Staring
</h2>
<p>"I did have some moments when it was awkward for me as a woman," Ms Olson said of her interactions in virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>She was visiting Meta's Horizon Worlds, its virtual-reality platform where anyone 18 or older can create an avatar and hang out.</p>

<p>To do so, users need one of Meta's VR headsets, and the space offers the chance to play games and chat to other avatars, none of whom has legs.</p>

<p>"I could see straight away I was the only woman, the only female avatar. And I had these men kind of come around me and stare at me silently," Ms Olson told Tech Tent.</p>

<p>"Then they started taking pictures of me and giving the pictures to me and I had a moment when a guy zoomed up to me and said something.</p>

<p>"And in virtual reality, if someone is close to you, then the voice sounds like someone is literally talking into your ear. And it took me aback."</p>

<p>She experienced similar discomfort in Microsoft's social VR platform.</p>

<p>"I was talking to another lady and within minutes of us chatting a guy came up and started chatting to us and following us around saying inappropriate things and we had to block him," she said.</p>

<p>"I have since heard of other women who have had similar experiences."</p>

<p>She said while she wouldn't describe it as harassment, it was "creepy and awkward".</p>

<p>Nina Jane Patel went a lot further this week when she told the Daily Mail that she was abused in Horizon Venues, likening it to sexual assault. She described how a group of male avatars "groped her" and subjected her to a stream of sexual innuendo. They photographed her and sent a message reading: "Don't pretend you didn't love it."</p>

<p>Meta responded to the paper saying that it was sorry. "We want everyone to have a positive experience and easily find the safety tools that can help in a situation like this - and help us investigate and take action."</p>

<p>Moderating content in the nascent metaverse is going to be challenging, and Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, admitted that it would offer both "greater opportunities and greater threats".</p>

<p>"It could feel a lot more real to me, if you were being abusive towards me because it feels a lot more like physical space," he said in an interview with the BBC late last year.</p>

<p>But he said people in virtual roles would have "a great deal more power" over their environments.</p>

<p>"If I were to mute you, you would cease to exist for me and your ability to do harm to me is immediately nullified."</p>
