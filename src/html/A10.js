          <h1>Koo: India's Twitter alternative with global ambitions</h1>
          <img src={a10im1} alt="" />
          <p>
            <b>Can Indian microblogging app Koo beat Twitter?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            That's certainly the goal, according to co-founder Mayank Bidawatka,
            who says Koo expects to surpass Twitter's 25 million-strong user
            base in India this year.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            It had touched 20 million downloads in India by the end of 2021.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are now available in 10 languages, including English. This year
            we'd like to cover all of India's 22 official languages," he told
            the BBC at the company's headquarters in the southern city of
            Bangalore, a tech hub.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koo was thrust into the spotlight last year as an alternative to
            Twitter amid a row between{" "}
            <b>the Indian government and the US microblogging platform.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government asked the platform to
            block allegedly incendiary accounts - Twitter complied initially and
            then restored them, citing "insufficient justification". The
            face-off continued as the government threatened legal action against
            the company's employees in India.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was in addition to an ongoing dispute over new digital rules
            that sparked concerns about free speech and privacy. WhatsApp sued
            the government, saying the rules would force it to violate privacy
            protections.
          </p>

          <p>
            Irked by Twitter's defiance and alleged failure to comply with
            digital rules, a flurry of cabinet ministers and lawmakers from Mr
            Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) migrated to Koo overnight. Mr
            Modi, who has a huge following on Twitter, has stayed put.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koo, which caters primarily to non-English users in India, launched
            in early 2020. It expanded to Nigeria in 2021 when the country
            suspended Twitter. It now wants to reach 100 million users by the
            end of 2022.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr Bidawatka founded Koo along with Aparmeya Radhakrishna, an angel
            investor and entrepreneur whose ride-sharing business TaxiForSure
            was acquired by the Indian company Ola for $200m (Â£147m) in 2015.
            The two also run Vokal, a knowledge-sharing platform in Indian
            languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since last year, Koo has attracted cricketers and Bollywood stars -
            and it expects the number of "eminent accounts", which now number
            5,000, to triple by the end of the year.
          </p>

          <p>
            But it's also accused of amplifying government propaganda and
            letting anti-Muslim hate speech go unchecked.
          </p>

          <p>
            Social media has become yet another battleground in a sharply
            polarised India - and the supporters of the Hindu nationalist BJP
            have long been accused of relentlessly trolling those who are seen
            as critical or opposed to Mr Modi.
          </p>
          <img src={a10im2} alt="" />
          <p>
            oo's guidelines explicitly prohibit hate speech and discriminatory
            or offensive content. But with "koos" (its version of tweets) being
            generated every second, moderation is hard, as is the case on other
            social media platforms, including Twitter.
          </p>

          <p>
            KMr Bidawatka says the problem needs to be solved using technology
            rather than human moderators, and by involving the user community to
            flag posts they deem toxic.
          </p>

          <p>
            KHe says that there are "a lot of BJP folk" on Koo, but disagrees
            that it's an echo chamber of right-leaning, anti-liberal voices. He
            adds that the app hosts opposition leaders from 19 other parties,
            including state chief ministers from the main opposition Congress
            party.
          </p>

          <p>
            K"There will always be some early adoptors. But how you start, and
            what happens in the beginning should not define your entire
            journey," Mr Bidawatka said. "As entrepreneurs, there is no reason
            for us to create something that only a section of the population
            will use."
          </p>

          <p>
            KBut according to Nikhil Pahwa, a digital rights activist, there is
            a clear rationale for Mr Modi's government to promote Koo as a
            homegrown, even "nationalist" alternative to Twitter, so that it can
            create a "soft landing spot" for itself, in case the need to ban
            Twitter arises in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            KMuch like the Chinese "splinternet", where the state controls
            cyberspace, India has, over the years, been pushing for greater
            digital sovereignty and control of its internet, Mr Pahwa says.
          </p>

          <p>
            KThese wider trends "will provide further tailwinds to Indian-owned
            platforms (like Koo)," he adds.
          </p>

          <p>
            KHe also notes that global big tech, governed by policies around
            data and security "will find it increasingly difficult to grow in
            India".
          </p>

          <p>
            KKoo has a fair shot at success, he believes, if it can solve the
            issue of how best to moderate content, while creating a safe space
            for users, which Twitter has long struggled with.
          </p>
          <img src={a10im3} alt="" />
          <p>
            But it will need to make a more concerted effort to attract users
            with a diversity of political views. As of now, liberal or
            anti-establishment voices might be disinclined to leave Twitter or
            have an account on both platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The app's requirement for authentication via a mobile phone number
            to register will also pose a challenge, Mr Pahwa says, because while
            it would allow Koo to moderate content better, it "takes away the
            comfort of anonymity" that Twitter grants to its users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still, Koo's distinctive focus on building a product for non-English
            speakers makes it a compelling product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the last few months the company has experimented a lot, such as
            giving people the ability to 'koo' in multiple languages at once,
            and on one screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr Bidawatka says Bollywood actors - who usually communicate with
            their fans in English on social media - make use of this feature to
            reach wider audiences across multiple languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Koo currently competes with ShareChat in India, a far bigger rival
            in terms of its user base. As it scales up across Indian languages,
            it will be doubling its headcount to 500 people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Buoyed by the platform's success in Nigeria, Mr Bidawatka plans to
            take the platform to countries outside India where English is not
            the dominant language.
          </p>

          <p>
            "South East Asia is exciting because of the large population and
            under-penetration of existing platforms. That's definitely on the
            cards," Mr Bidawatka says.
          </p>

          <p>
            "English is spoken by only 20% of the world - 80% of the world does
            not speak English," he adds. "That entire market is open to us."
